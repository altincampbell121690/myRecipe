## Overview
### Description
Recommends recipes based on what you have in your kitchen

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Diet/ Health
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily used as a mobile kitchen assitant app; the goal is to help eleminate the need of asking "what's for dinner".
- **Story:** Analyzes users items on hand in their pantry, and recommends recipes based on their dietary restrictions or perfered eating habits.
- **Market:** Any individual who wants to eat out less could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** I plan to start small and add features over time. For now, the app will be a solo experience. In time I plan to add a social aspect.
